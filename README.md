# **0x11. C - printf**

In this project we are going to create our `_printf`  function.

#### Github

There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

## Compilation

    Your code will be compiled this way:

`$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c`

    As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions)
    Our main files will include your main header file (holberton.h): #include holberton.h
   - You might want to look at the gcc flag -Wno-format when testing with your _printf and the standard printf.

   - We strongly encourage you to work all together on a set of tests
    If the task does not specify what to do with an edge case, do the same as printf.

    - If the task does not specify what to do with an edge case, do the same as printf

#### Tasks

0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life


1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't


2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel mandatory

Create a man page for your function.
