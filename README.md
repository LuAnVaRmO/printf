# **0x11. C - printf**

In this project we are going to create our `_printf`  function.

#### Github

There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

##Compilation

    Your code will be compiled this way:

`$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c`

    As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions)
    Our main files will include your main header file (holberton.h): #include holberton.h
   - You might want to look at the gcc flag -Wno-format when testing with your _printf and the standard printf.


   - We strongly encourage you to work all together on a set of tests
    If the task does not specify what to do with an edge case, do the same as printf
